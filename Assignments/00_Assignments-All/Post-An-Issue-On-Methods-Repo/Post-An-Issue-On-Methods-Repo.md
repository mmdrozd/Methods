A key part of how interactions on GitHub work is that people who are not core "contributors" to 
a repo can point out problems, suggest solutions, or discuss directions by "posting an issue."

The course material for the Methods class suffers from many imperfections, and some outright errors,
which you will have noticed as you have tried to do the course work. 

This assignment is to:

0. Find a tutorial on GitHub that teaches you about how "issues" work
0. Identify some aspect of the Methods repo about which it would make sense to post an "issue"
   * This can be an outright error or something that is confusing or some content you think should be added, or anything else that your research tells you is an appropriate use of the "issue" mechanism in GitHub.
