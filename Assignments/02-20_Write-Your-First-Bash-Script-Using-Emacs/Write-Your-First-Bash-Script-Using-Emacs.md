# Write Your First Bash Script Using Emacs

This assignment takes you through the process of writing your first bash script using Emacs in your VM.

Before beginning the assignment, please read through the first two chapters, [Inception](https://guide.bash.academy/inception/)
and [Commands and Arguments](https://guide.bash.academy/commands/) of [The Bash Guide](https://guide.bash.academy/) and
do the associated exercises.

When that is done, complete the assignment below (which combines elementary bash with elementary Emacs usage)

0. Launch `Emacs` from the terminal using the command `emacs -nw` 
   
   Done [MMD]
0. Create a new file by hitting C-x C-f (that's short for CTRL-x followed by CTRL-f)

   * Emacs will pop up a little `minibuffer` at the _bottom_ of the terminal saying `Find file:`

   * This is its way of asking you the filename you want to use

   * Give it a filename `First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh`
   
   Done [MMD]

0. As the first line of the script, enter the exact letters `#!/bin/bash`

   * This is the magic spell that identifies the file as a bash script file
   
   Done[MMD]
0. Now hit return a couple of times and type `echo "Hello world!"`
   
   Done [MMD]
0. Hit `C-x C-s` (Control-x followed by Control-s) to save the file
   
   Done [MMD]
0. Hit `C-x C-c` to exit from Emacs
   
   Done [MMD]
0. In the `Terminal` shell, type `cd ~` to change the directory to the home directory `~` where you created the file
   
	   Done [MMD]
0. Before the file can be executed, it must be marked as executable.

   * This is done using the `chmod` command (short for `change the modification characteristics of the file`)

   * The specific command you must use is `chmod a+x *.sh`

   * The `*.sh` syntax means `all files ending in .sh`

	Done [MMD]
0. Now you should be able to execute the file in either of two ways:

   0. Type `/bin/bash First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh`

   0. Type `./First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh`
   
	   Done [MMD]
0. Capture the magnificent results of your efforts in an output file by adding ` > First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].out` after typing one of the above options to execute the .sh file. For example,

   `./First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh  > First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].out`
   
	   Done [MMD]
0. View the results in two ways:

   0.  At the shell type `cat *.out`

      * The `cat` command gives a `catalog` of the contents of the files that are its argument

      * Since there is only one file ending in `.out` the catalog has only your program's output

   0. Open the file using the command `emacs First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].out`

      * You will notice that this time, Emacs opens as a graphical application in its own window

      * The reason is that your previous invocation of emacs included the `-nw` flag, which is short for `no window` and has the effect of launching emacs inside the shell window
  
	  Done[MMD]
0. Update your local copy of the class "Methods" repository:

    `cd ~/GitHub/ccarrollATjhuecon/Methods`
    `git pull`

	Done[MMD]
0. Move your script to the /Assignments/[##-##]-Write-Your-First-Bash-Script-Using-Emacs in the
local copy the "Methods" repo

	Done [MMD]
